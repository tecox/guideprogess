1.  A header file that allows us to declare our own fixed-width integer types.
2.  Declaring your own names for types based on purpose in the program, and setting them ourselves makes them more predictable than the standard types.
3.  1, 4, 4, 2
4.  0x4d42
5.  bfSize is the total file size in bytes. biSize is the number of bytes required for the BITMAPINFOHEADER struct (40).
6.  We are dealing with a top-down bitmap with an origin in the upper left corner. Also, the file must be uncompressed.
7.  biBitCount
8.  If the infile doesn't exist or the outfile can't be written.
9.  We are only reading one element of data from the given file.
10. 3
11. Offsets the file position indicator for the given file by a chosen number of bytes.
12. One of the values fseek can offset the file position indicator relative to, in this case the current position indicator.
